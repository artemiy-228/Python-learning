# None

The **None** object is used to represent the absence of a value.
It is similar to **null** in other programming languages.
Like other "empty" values, such as 0, [] and the empty string, it is False when converted to a Boolean variable.
When entered at the Python console, it is displayed as the empty string.

	print(None)

## What is none?

The None object is returned by any function that doesn't explicitly return anything else.

	def some_func():
   	     print("Hi!")

	var = some_func()
	print(var)
	# Output is Hi! and None

# String Formating

So far, to combine strings and non-strings, you've converted the non-strings to strings and added them.
**String formatting** provides a more powerful way to embed non-strings within **strings**.
**String formatting** uses a **string's** format method to substitute a number of arguments in the **string**.
	# string formatting
	nums = [4, 5, 6]
	msg = "Numbers: {0} {1} {2}". format(nums[0], nums[1], nums[2])
	print(msg)

Hint: Each argument of the format function is placed in the string at the corresponding position, which is determined using the curly braces { }.

**String formatting** can also be done with name
