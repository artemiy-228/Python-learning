Exception Handling

To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can use a try/except statement.
The try block contains code that might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the try block stops being executed, and the code in the except block is run. If no error occurs, the code in the except block doesn't run.
